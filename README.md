Project for Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning.

This repository contains a notebook that answers 3 questions about the foundations of machine learning:

1. Which steps of the feature engineering process have the most positive effect on increasing the efficiency of our model?
2. What is the impact of different scaling techniques on the accuracy and convergence speed of classifiers using tree-based, distance-based and gradient descent-based algorithms?
3. What is the impact of the training size & data augmentation on the accuracy of a model?
